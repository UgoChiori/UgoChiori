### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ugo Chiori!  
Iâ€™m a **software developer** based in **Lagos, Nigeria** with a passion for building great user experiences. My journey into tech began in **April 2022** when I started learning **front-end development**, and since then, Iâ€™ve been all inâ€”taking on diverse projects, solving real-world problems, and continuously expanding my skill set.  

### ðŸŒŸ What I Do  
- Front-end development with **React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**  
- Exploring **Open Source** contributions  
- Learning new technologies and best practices  

### ðŸŽ¯ Beyond Code  
Before transitioning into tech, I spent **15 years as a baker**, perfecting recipes and delivering excellenceâ€”skills that translate well into software development: precision, creativity, and problem-solving. Outside of coding, youâ€™ll find me **bowling, working out, or enjoying a great cup of coffee**.
